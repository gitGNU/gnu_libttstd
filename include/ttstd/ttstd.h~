 * The ttstd library has basic functions for communicating with hardware 
 * and hardware drivers from golinux on TomTom navigation devices and provides
 * the gained information in easily accessible structs and variables.\n
 * See \ref features "Currently implemented features"\n

 *
 * \section install_sec Installation
 * \li please see INSTALL file in libttstd root directory
 *
 * \section example_sec Examples
 * \li see test.c for an example that implements nearly all functions of ttstd
 *
 * \section help_sec Help Wanted ;)
 * If anyone likes to help or has some code/functions that would fit into ttstd please contact \ref developers "the developers" :-)

 * functions for getting NMEA strings and parsing them to GPS coordinates

 * \section touchscreen Touchscreen
 * functions for interfacing with the touchscreen (e.g. x/y pos and pressure)\n
 * see touchscreen.h for more details

/*!
 * \page dep_nmealib Dependency: NMEA Library
 * ttstd lib needs nmealib for parsing the NMEA GPS-Strings from the gpspipe to useful data in the structs\n
 * NMEA Library homepage: http://nmea.sourceforge.net \n\n
 * for this version of ttstd nmealib 0.5.3 was used which can be found at http://downloads.sourceforge.net/nmea/nmealib-0.5.3.zip 
 * (newer versions should work, too.)\n\n
 * There were little changes made to the Makefile in order to compile for the ARM architecture, \n
 * a full .diff file can be found at \ref Makefile.diff "nmealib/Makefile.diff" in the ttstd directory
